This is a car searching project that I implemented search part with MERN stack.

The reference site I used to develop is https://www.iautohaus.ca/inventory/search?page=1&page_length=5&make=Aston%20Martin&transmission=automatic&year=2012&stock_type=Used

I have developed the search page using filters like Make , Model , Year , Price , Mileage.
I have used Atlas MongoDB as a database and MERN stack for project structure.
I have used Redux for storing search parameters.
